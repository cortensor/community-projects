# CortensorView: Observability Dashboard for the Cortensor Network

**CortensorView** is a production-ready monitoring and analytics dashboard for the Cortensor decentralized inference network. 
Built for Hackathon #2, it provides comprehensive observability tools for network operators, developers, and community members.

## What It Does
- Real-time network monitoring with metrics for active nodes, requests, latency, and success rates
- Node pool management with leaderboard rankings and performance heatmaps
- Session tracking with search and analytics capabilities
- Task monitoring with status distribution and success rate tracking
- Interactive API Explorer for testing endpoints

## Technical Stack
- React 18 with TypeScript
- Vite for fast builds
- Tailwind CSS for styling
- Recharts for data visualization
