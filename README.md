# Cortensor Community Projects

This repository serves as a central hub for **community-built tools, apps, and infrastructure** that extend and support the Cortensor decentralized AI network.

Whether you're building a Telegram bot, monitoring tool, custom dashboard, or deploying node infra — this is the place to collaborate, consolidate, and ship together.

## 📁 Repository Structure

Projects are organized into three main directories:

🔹 `tools/` — Utility scripts, monitoring bots, helpers  
🔹 `apps/` — Community-facing applications built on Cortensor APIs  
🔹 `infras/` — Deployment scripts, Docker templates, node automation

Each project should include:
- `README.md` — What the project does and how to use it
- `STATUS.md` — Project status, roadmap, and known issues
- `RELEASE.md` — Changelog and version history
- Entry in the root-level `PROJECTS.yml`
- Must comply with the shared [MIT License](./LICENSE.md)

## 🚀 Getting Started with Templates

We provide "Hello World" templates for each category to help you bootstrap your own projects quickly:

### Using the Templates

   - `apps/hello-world-bot` - Template for application projects
   - `tools/hello-world-tool` - Template for utility tools
   - `infras/hello-world-infra` - Template for infrastructure projects

2. **Copy the template** to create your new project:

   ```bash
   # For a new app
   cp -r apps/hello-world-bot apps/your-project-name
